eDNA Baseline Analysis – Lake Restoration Project

This project analyzes environmental DNA (eDNA) samples collected from three lake zones (North, Central, South) as part of an ongoing restoration and dredging assessment effort. The objective is to establish a biological baseline prior to sediment removal, helping to understand how dredging impacts macroinvertebrate and microbial biodiversity across the lake.

Project Breakdown
Using high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools, we identified the presence of various genera across thousands of detections. The analysis focused on spatial distribution and abundance of key taxa, such as *Stylaria* and *Macrocyclops*, to understand regional biodiversity and ecosystem health indicators.

Data Breakdown

- **South** – 59,673 detections, 64 genera
- **Central** – 39,988 detections (15,000 nulls), 42 genera
- **North** – 47,872 detections, 16 genera

Key Features

- Bubble charts show proportional presence of detected genera
- Interactive geospatial mapping of sample zones
- Color-coded summaries by site (North = Red, Central = Orange, South = Green)
- Designed to monitor shifts in biodiversity following dredging activity

Tools Used

- R (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)
- Leaflet for mapping
- Bioinformatics-preprocessed eDNA datasets (CSV format)
- Tableau (for visuals)

Ongoing Work

This analysis represents the **baseline** prior to dredging. Future work will compare these results to post-dredge samples to evaluate:
- Species reemergence or disappearance
- Biodiversity shifts
- Overall ecosystem response
